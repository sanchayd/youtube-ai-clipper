# YouTube AI Clipper - System Architecture

## Overview

YouTube AI Clipper is designed as a serverless application that processes YouTube videos to extract segments where specific topics are mentioned. The architecture follows cloud-native best practices, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and cost-efficiency.

## System Components

### 1. Media Acquisition Layer

This layer is responsible for interacting with YouTube to retrieve video metadata and content.

- **YouTube API Integration**: Uses the official YouTube Data API to reliably access video metadata even from restricted environments like AWS Lambda
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts the data source with a clean interface that could support multiple video platforms in the future
- **Input Validation**: Handles various YouTube URL formats and validates constraints (e.g., maximum duration)

### 2. AI Analysis Pipeline (Planned)

This component will analyze video content to identify relevant segments.

- **Speech Recognition**: Will convert audio to text with timestamp information
- **Topic Detection**: Will identify segments where target topics are mentioned
- **Relevance Scoring**: Will rank segments by relevance to target topics

### 3. Media Processing Engine (Planned)

This component will handle the extraction and processing of video clips.

- **Clip Generator**: Will extract segments from source videos
- **Format Converter**: Will process clips into formats suitable for social media platforms

### 4. API Layer

This component exposes the functionality through a REST API.

- **API Gateway**: Provides HTTP endpoints with request validation
- **Lambda Functions**: Process requests and orchestrate the underlying components

## Design Patterns

The architecture implements several important design patterns:

- **Repository Pattern**: Used in the Media Acquisition Layer to abstract the data source
- **Factory Pattern**: Used to create the appropriate repository implementation
- **Command Pattern**: Will be used for processing tasks in the AI Analysis Pipeline
- **Strategy Pattern**: Will be used in the Media Processing Engine for different output formats

## Technical Decisions

### YouTube API vs. Scraping Libraries

The project initially used `pytube` (a scraping library) but faced reliability issues in AWS Lambda environments. We switched to the official YouTube Data API for several reasons:

1. **Reliability**: Not subject to IP blocking that affects scraping libraries
2. **Stability**: Provides a stable, documented interface
3. **Compliance**: Adheres to YouTube's terms of service
4. **Feature Support**: Offers rich metadata and filtering capabilities

### Serverless Architecture

We chose a serverless architecture for several benefits:

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for actual usage
2. **Scalability**: Automatic scaling based on demand
3. **Reduced Operational Overhead**: No server management required
4. **Event-Driven**: Natural fit for the processing pipeline

### Python 3.10

Python 3.10 was selected for:

1. **AI Library Support**: Excellent ecosystem for AI/ML processing
2. **AWS Lambda Support**: Well-supported runtime in AWS Lambda
3. **Developer Productivity**: Rapid development with rich libraries

## Infrastructure as Code

The infrastructure is defined using AWS SAM templates, providing:

1. **Reproducibility**: Environment can be recreated precisely
2. **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes are tracked alongside code
3. **Deployment Automation**: Streamlined deployment process

## Future Architecture Considerations

1. **Parallel Processing**: Implementing parallel processing for larger videos
2. **Caching Layer**: Adding Redis or DynamoDB for caching results
3. **Background Processing**: Moving to an asynchronous model with SQS/SNS for longer jobs
4. **User Authentication**: Adding Cognito for user management
5. **CDN Integration**: Using CloudFront for delivering generated clips

## Monitoring and Observability

Planned implementation includes:

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**: For performance monitoring
2. **X-Ray Tracing**: For request tracing
3. **Structured Logging**: For debugging and analysis
4. **Alarms**: For proactive issue detection

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable application while allowing for future expansion.
