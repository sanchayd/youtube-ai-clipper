YouTube AI Clipper - System Architecture
üéØ Overview
YouTube AI Clipper is a serverless application designed to analyze YouTube videos and extract topic-specific clips. The architecture follows cloud-native patterns, emphasizing scalability, maintainability, and cost-efficiency.
üèóÔ∏è System Components
1. API Layer
AWS API Gateway serves as the entry point:

RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI documentation
CORS support for web applications
Request validation and rate limiting
Integration with AWS Lambda for processing

2. Compute Layer
AWS Lambda Functions handle all processing:

Event-driven serverless execution
Automatic scaling based on demand
Pay-per-request pricing model
Integrated with CloudWatch for monitoring

3. Service Architecture
The application follows a microservices pattern within Lambda:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YouTubeService          # Video metadata retrieval
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TranscriptionService    # Speech-to-text processing  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TopicService           # Topic detection and analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AudioService           # Audio extraction utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ VideoHandler           # Request orchestration
4. External Integrations
YouTube Data API v3:

Official Google API for video metadata
Reliable access to video information
Respects platform terms of service
Provides rich metadata (views, duration, thumbnails)

OpenAI Whisper API (Optional):

Production-grade speech recognition
Support for multiple languages
Timestamp-accurate transcription
Fallback to demo data when unavailable

üîß Technical Implementation
Service-Oriented Design
Each service implements a clear interface:
pythonclass YouTubeService:
    def extract_video_id(self, url: str) -> str
    def get_video_info(self, video_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]

class TopicService:
    def find_topic_mentions(self, transcript: Dict, topic: str) -> List[Dict]
    def generate_clip_timestamps(self, mentions: List) -> List[Dict]
Error Handling Strategy
Graceful Degradation: The system continues operating when external services fail:

YouTube API unavailable ‚Üí Falls back to demo metadata
Whisper API unavailable ‚Üí Uses enhanced demo transcription
Network issues ‚Üí Returns partial results with status indicators

Circuit Breaker Pattern: Prevents cascade failures:
pythontry:
    result = external_api_call()
except APIException:
    logger.warning("API unavailable, using fallback")
    result = get_fallback_data()
Caching Strategy
In-Memory Caching: Videos metadata cached within Lambda execution:
pythonself._cache = {}  # Simple LRU cache for video info
Future Enhancement: Redis or DynamoDB for persistent caching across executions.
